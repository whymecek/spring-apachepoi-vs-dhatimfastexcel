# spring-apachepoi-vs-dhatimfastexcel

This research only compares read excel performance and memory used between the apachePoi lib and dhatim.fastexcel. when the excel file reaches 1 million rows in apache Poi needs more ram in the end memory out and java heap error. this does not happen in the dhatim.fastexcel lib

the result is very clear that lib dhatim.fastexcel wins. testing data is Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.xlsx. There are 1 million rows just copy paste to reach 1 million rows. Screencap test results can be seen in the image folder
